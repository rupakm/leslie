/-! ## LastVoting via PhaseRoundAlg

    Reimplementation of the LastVoting (Paxos / HO model) protocol using
    the `PhaseRoundAlg` multi-phase round framework from `PhaseRound.lean`.

    ### Protocol overview

    LastVoting is the Heard-Of model formulation of Paxos, due to
    Charron-Bost & Schiper (2009). Each **ballot** (logical round)
    consists of 4 **phases**:

    | Phase | Name      | Paxos equivalent | What happens                              |
    |-------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
    | 0     | Prepare   | 1a               | Coordinator broadcasts prepare            |
    | 1     | Promise   | 1b               | Processes send lastVote; coordinator      |
    |       |           |                  | collects and picks proposal               |
    | 2     | Accept    | 2a               | Coordinator broadcasts proposal           |
    | 3     | Decide    | 2b               | Processes check majority acceptance       |

    ### Mapping to PhaseRoundAlg

    `PhaseRoundAlg` expects uniform `send` / `update` functions per phase
    that apply to every process. The coordinator asymmetry is handled by
    branching on `round mod n` inside the send/update functions:

    - **Phase 0 (Prepare):**
      - `send`: coordinator sends `PrepareMsg.prepare`, others send
        `PrepareMsg.skip`.
      - `update`: process records `prepared := true` if it received a
        prepare from the coordinator. Resets `accepted := false`.

    - **Phase 1 (Promise):**
      - `send`: every process sends its `lastVote`.
      - `update`: *coordinator* counts promises; if majority (≥ 2 of 3),
        computes proposal via `highestVote` and stores it in local state
        (`proposal` field). Non-coordinator: no change.

    - **Phase 2 (Accept):**
      - `send`: coordinator sends `AcceptMsg.propose v` (from stored
        proposal). Non-coordinator sends `AcceptMsg.skip`.
      - `update`: if process received a `propose v` from the coordinator,
        it accepts: sets `lastVote := (v, round)` and `accepted := true`.

    - **Phase 3 (Decide):**
      - `send`: process sends `DecideMsg.accepted` or `.notAccepted`.
      - `update`: if majority sent `.accepted`, process decides the value
        from its `lastVote` (which matches the proposal).

    ### Coordinator identity

    The coordinator of a ballot is `round mod 3`, where `round` is the
    PhaseRoundAlg round counter. This counter increments once per complete
    4-phase ballot, so it serves as the ballot number.

    ### Design note: proposal in local state

    The coordinator must remember its proposal between Phase 1 (where it
    computes the proposal) and Phase 2 (where it broadcasts it). We store
    the proposal in the local state's `proposal` field. Only the
    coordinator writes this field (in Phase 1's update). Phase 2's send
    reads it back.

/-! ### PhaseRoundAlg assembly

    We need to package the 4 phases into a `PhaseRoundAlg`.
    The challenge is that our send/update functions depend on the
    `round` number (for coordinator computation), but the `Phase` type
    only receives `P` and `S`.

    Solution: we thread the round number through the local state.  We
    add a `roundNum` field to local state that tracks the current round.
    Alternatively, we can define the algorithm as a function of round
    number and use the `PhaseRoundState.round` field.

    Actually, `PhaseRoundAlg.phases` gives us `Phase P S (Msgs i)` which
    does NOT have access to the round number. But `phase_step` applies
    the phase to `PhaseRoundState` which has the round number.

    We work around this by storing the round number in the local state.
    Phase 3's update increments it (to stay in sync with the global
    round counter). -/

/-! ### Invariant

    The inductive invariant combines several properties:

    (A) **Agreement**: all existing decisions agree.

    (B) **Accepted consistency**: if a process has `accepted = true`,
        its `lastVote` matches the current ballot's proposal.

    (C) **Phase 3 consistency**: in phase 3, acceptors' lastVotes match
        the proposal.

    (D) **Decision-proposal consistency**: any existing decision agrees
        with the current proposal (if a majority accepted).

    (E) **Round synchronization**: `roundNum` in local state matches the
        global round counter. -/

/-! ### Quorum intersection (reused from the framework)

    The `cross_phase_quorum_intersection` theorem from `PhaseRound.lean`
    provides the key quorum argument: any two majority HO sets among
    `Fin 3` must share a process. This is essential for Paxos safety:
    the promise quorum (Phase 1) and accept quorum (Phase 3) overlap.

    We instantiate it here for `n = 3` for documentation purposes. -/

/-! ### Full cross-ballot invariant (stated, proof deferred)

    The key Paxos safety argument: if value `v` was accepted by a majority
    in ballot `b`, then any proposal in ballot `b' > b` must also propose `v`.

    The argument uses quorum intersection at the Promise phase: the
    coordinator of `b'` collects promises from a majority; by
    `maj3_intersect`, this majority overlaps with the majority that
    accepted `v` in ballot `b`. The `highestVote` selection ensures the
    coordinator picks `v` (or a value from an even higher ballot, which
    by induction is also `v`).

    This requires a history-tracking strengthening of the invariant,
    which we leave as sorry. -/
