M3 entry gate — `ASTCertificate` and `FairASTCertificate`.

This module defines the certificate structures for almost-sure
termination (AST) under, respectively, demonic and weakly-fair
adversaries. The structures encode the proof rules from:

  * **POPL 2025** Majumdar–Sathiyanarayana, Rule 3.2 — likelihood
    supermartingale `V` plus distance variant `U` with sublevel-set
    compatibility (`ASTCertificate`).
  * **POPL 2026** ibid., fair extension — same shape but with
    supermartingale / variant conditions required only under fair
    adversaries (`FairASTCertificate`).

## Status (M3 W0 — entry gate)

Both structures are declared with **field types pinned down**. The
`*.sound` theorems and helper lemmas carry `sorry`s; the goal of
the entry gate is to verify that the *shape* compiles cleanly
against the AVSS termination certificate (`Examples/Prob/AVSSStub.lean`).
The actual soundness proofs land in M3 W1–W2.

## Why two certificates

The demonic AST rule alone is insufficient for AVSS termination:
the AVSS protocol terminates only under fair scheduling (the
adversary cannot indefinitely starve honest delivery). The fair
extension restricts the supermartingale / variant conditions to
fair adversaries, matching the temporal-logic side condition
`□◇⟨honestDeliver⟩` (etc.) baked into `FairnessAssumptions`.

/-! ## ASTCertificate (POPL 2025 Rule 3.2)

Demonic AST rule. The certificate package:

  * `Inv` — an inductive invariant that holds along every execution
    (modulo the initial-state predicate).
  * `V` — a non-negative likelihood supermartingale, zero on
    terminated states. Witnesses that the protocol "doesn't drift
    away" from termination indefinitely.
  * `U` — a non-negative integer-valued distance variant, zero on
    terminated states, decreasing with positive probability on
    every step within the sublevel set `{V ≤ k}` for every `k`.

Both `V` and `U` are needed: `V` alone gives "termination has
positive probability", `U` upgrades that to "almost-sure
termination" via the strong-Markov-style pumping argument in the
POPL 2025 proof. -/

/-- Demonic almost-sure-termination certificate (POPL 2025 Rule 3.2).

The fields encode the proof obligations the POPL 2025 demonic AST
rule requires.

**No `sound` theorem is exported for this structure.** The demonic
rule is provably false under our `Adversary` model because of the
stuttering schedule (`A.schedule _ = none` everywhere). Concrete
protocols in this development use `FairASTCertificate` (POPL 2026
fair extension) instead — fairness rules out indefinite stuttering
on fair-required actions, restoring soundness. See
`docs/randomized-leslie-spike/10-stuttering-adversary-finding.md`.
The structure is retained so calibration tests
(e.g., `Examples/Prob/RandomWalker1D.lean`) can validate the
certificate field shape; lifting helpers `liftV` / `liftU` are kept
for any future demonic-AST development. -/

  /-- `V` is uniformly bounded on the invariant set.

  **Why this field is needed.** Without a uniform bound, the
  `pi_infty_zero` step of soundness would invoke Doob's L¹-bounded
  martingale convergence — but a non-negative supermartingale's L¹
  norm is bounded by its initial expectation, which can be infinite
  if `V` is unbounded on `μ₀`'s support. Adding this field makes
  the trajectory `liftV cert n ω = V (ω n).1` uniformly bounded
  by `K` for every `ω` in the AE-set where `Inv` holds, which
  collapses `pi_infty_zero` to the trivial case (the bad set is
  empty) and reduces soundness to `pi_n_AST K`.

  Concrete protocols typically satisfy this: AVSS / Bracha / random
  walker all have state-bounded `V` since the protocol's reachable
  state space is bounded by the initial parameters. The field is
  also what POPL 2025 §3.2's actual statement requires (the paper
  uses an L¹-bounded supermartingale; we strengthen to a uniform
  bound on the invariant for cleaner Lean statement). -/

/-! ### Soundness — NOT provided for the demonic version

The POPL 2025 §3 Lemma 3.2 demonic AST rule is **provably false**
under our `Adversary` model, which permits stuttering schedules
(`A.schedule _ = none` everywhere). On such a stuttering trace the
state is constant, so any `cert.V (ω n).1 ≤ N` hypothesis is
trivially satisfied while termination need not hold. The standard
POPL 2025 statement implicitly assumes a non-stuttering adversary;
our weaker `Adversary` model makes the rule unsound as-stated.

We therefore **do not export** `ASTCertificate.sound`. Concrete
protocols use `FairASTCertificate.sound` (the POPL 2026 fair
extension) instead — fairness rules out indefinite stuttering on
fair-required actions, restoring soundness. The fair version's
`sound` is closed (modulo trajectory-form witnesses on the
caller's side). For deterministic-decrease protocols, callers can
use `FairASTCertificate.pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det` directly
through a `TrajectoryFairAdversary` bundle (see AVSS's
`avss_termination_AS_fair_traj` for the worked pattern). A
consumer-friendly corollary `sound_traj_det` packaging this is
deferred (see lines 1698–1712).

Possible future work: refine `ASTCertificate` with a non-stuttering
field on the adversary (a `progress`-style hypothesis ruling out
indefinite stuttering at non-terminated states), restoring the
demonic rule to soundness. Documented in
`docs/randomized-leslie-spike/10-stuttering-adversary-finding.md`.
For now, only the structure `ASTCertificate` itself is exported,
without a soundness theorem; calibration tests
(e.g., `Examples/Prob/RandomWalker1D.lean`) construct certificate
instances to validate the structure's API but don't invoke
soundness.

The coordinate-lift helpers `liftV` and `liftU` below are kept as
useful primitives for any future demonic-AST development. -/

/-! ## FairASTCertificate (POPL 2026 fair extension)

Same shape as `ASTCertificate`, but the supermartingale and
variant decrease conditions are required only under *weakly fair*
adversaries — i.e., adversaries that don't indefinitely starve
actions in `fair_actions`.

This rule is what AVSS termination needs: a corrupt-and-faulty
adversary can refuse to schedule honest delivery for arbitrarily
long, but cannot do so *forever* (that's the fairness assumption).
Under that constraint, the supermartingale eventually pays out. -/

/-! ### Soundness — proof skeleton

The fair soundness proof decomposes along the same `pi_n_AST` /
`pi_infty_zero` / `partition_almostDiamond` skeleton as the demonic
case. The sound rule implemented here is the monotone fair variant:
in addition to trajectory fair progress, callers provide AE witnesses
that `U` is non-increasing on all steps and strictly decreases on fair
firings in each `V` sublevel.

The three pieces are:

  * `pi_infty_zero_fair` — closed via `AlmostBox_of_inductive`
    + `V_init_bdd`, exactly as in the demonic case.
  * `partition_almostDiamond_fair` — closed by the partition
    argument once `pi_n_AST_fair` is provided.
  * `pi_n_AST_fair` — closed by the deterministic monotone
    specialization `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det`.

The older probabilistic chain witness remains below as a placeholder
for the more general conditional Borel-Cantelli development; it is no
longer on the `sound` path. -/

def liftU (cert : FairASTCertificate spec F terminated) (n : ℕ)

  cert.U ((ω n).1)

/- **Historical general fair sublevel rule sketch.** On the
sublevel set `{ω | ∀ k, cert.V (ω k).1 ≤ N}`, almost-sure
termination follows from `U_bdd_subl` plus the fair finite-variant
rule.

Unlike the (now-removed) demonic counterpart, this fair version
does **not** suffer the stuttering-adversary issue:
`A : FairAdversary σ ι F` carries the weakly-fair witness
`A.fair : F.isWeaklyFair A.toAdversary`, which forces every
fair-required action to fire eventually whenever continuously
enabled. So the `always-stutter` adversary that breaks the
demonic AST rule is excluded by the type signature.

**Status:** this sketch is not used for `FairASTCertificate.sound`.
The implemented rule is the monotone specialization below. The more
general positive-probability rule is tracked in
`docs/randomized-leslie-spike/13-fair-ast-borel-cantelli-plan.md`.

The proof sketch (assuming the assembly):
  1. From `A.fair`, every fair action is fired infinitely often AE.
  2. From `cert.U_dec_det` + `cert.U_dec_prob`, on every fair
     firing, `U` decreases (deterministically or with probability
     `p > 0` on the sublevel set `{V ≤ N}`).
  3. From `cert.U_bdd_subl N = M`, `U ≤ M` along the sublevel
     trajectory.
  4. Geometric tail bound: after at most `M / p` fair firings AE,
     `U` reaches `0`, which forces termination via
     `terminated`-equivalence on `U = 0` (from `cert.V_pos` +
     `cert.U_term`).

Tracked under M3 W3+. The general (non-monotone) Mathlib gap is
the conditional Borel-Cantelli filtration plumbing; see
`docs/randomized-leslie-spike/14-stopping-time-and-borel-cantelli.md`.

**Two stacked gaps** (see `docs/randomized-leslie-spike/11-fair-progress-blocker.md`):

  1. *Trajectory-progress witness gap*: `F.isWeaklyFair` has type
     `Adversary σ ι → Prop`, an opaque predicate. The proof needs
     "fair actions fire AE i.o. on the trajectory" — a trajectory-
     level statement. Concrete instances of `FairnessAssumptions`
     in our codebase (`brbFair`, `boFair`, `avssFair`) all use
     `isWeaklyFair := True` (placeholder), so the witness isn't
     extractable. The fix is to either (a) refine
     `FairnessAssumptions` with a trajectory-form fairness witness,
     or (b) take a `TrajectoryFairProgress` hypothesis (see
     `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` below).
  2. *Mathlib Borel–Cantelli + filtration plumbing*: even with the
     progress witness, assembling the geometric-tail argument
     requires the natural filtration on `Trace σ ι` and a
     conditional Borel–Cantelli specialization. ~250 LOC. -/
/-! ### Trajectory progress witness — gap 1 made explicit

This is the proof obligation the abstract `FairnessAssumptions.isWeaklyFair`
fails to deliver. `TrajectoryFairProgress` says: **AE on the trace
measure, every fair-required action fires infinitely often.**

POPL 2026 takes a similar trajectory-level fairness condition as
primitive in its rule statement; our `FairnessAssumptions` keeps
`isWeaklyFair` opaque to allow per-protocol concrete witnesses.

A future refactor of `FairnessAssumptions` to require a witness of
this shape would let `pi_n_AST_fair` be proved without an extra
hypothesis. Meanwhile, `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` takes the
witness explicitly. -/

/-! ### General-case proof — Lévy / conditional Borel-Cantelli sketch

The general `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` differs from the closed
deterministic specialisation in one place: at a fair firing, `U`
decreases *with probability ≥ p > 0* (from `U_dec_prob N = p`), not
deterministically. The certificate's `U_dec_det` allows the
disjunction "decrease at this step OR a new fair action becomes
enabled at the successor" — that disjunction is what blocks the
finite-descent argument used in the deterministic case.

The standard textbook proof (POPL 2026 Rule fair-AST, Lévy's
extension of Borel-Cantelli) decomposes as:

  1. **Filtration.** Take the natural filtration `ℱ` on `Trace σ ι`
     generated by coordinate projections `ω ↦ ω k` for `k ≤ n`.
     Mathlib provides `MeasureTheory.Filtration.natural`, but to
     instantiate it we need each coordinate (`σ × Option ι`) to be
     `MetrizableSpace + BorelSpace` — derivable from the discrete
     topology on `Countable + MeasurableSingletonClass` types but
     not in scope here.

  2. **Decrease events.** Let `D_n := {ω | cert.U (ω (n+1)).1 < cert.U (ω n).1}`.
     These are `ℱ (n+1)`-measurable under the discrete σ-algebra.

  3. **Conditional bound.** From `U_dec_prob N = p`, on the event
     "fair action `i ∈ F.fair_actions` fires at step `n+1` from a
     non-terminated state in the V-sublevel", the kernel structure
     of `traceDist` (specifically the marginal-recurrence equality
     in `Refinement.AlmostBox_of_inductive`) yields
     `μ[D_n | ℱ n] ≥ p · 1_{good_n}`.

  4. **Sum diverges AE.** From `_h_progress`, fair firings happen
     i.o. AE on the trajectory; combined with (3) the conditional
     probabilities `μ[D_n | ℱ n]` sum to ∞ AE on the sublevel.

  5. **Lévy extension of Borel-Cantelli.** Mathlib's
     `MeasureTheory.ae_mem_limsup_atTop_iff` gives `D_n` occurs
     i.o. AE on traces where the conditional sum diverges, *with the
     additional strength that the events are filtration-progressive*.

  6. **Bounded variant + i.o. drop-to-new-min ⇒ termination.** The
     conditional Borel-Cantelli output gives more than i.o. step-drop:
     it gives that the sequence of `U`-minima `U_∗_n := min_{k ≤ n} U (ω k).1`
     strictly decreases i.o. (because each `D_n` event occurring while
     `U_n = U_∗_n` lowers the minimum). Combined with `U_∗_n ∈ ℕ ∩ [0, M]`,
     the minimum can decrease at most `M+1` times, contradicting the
     supposed i.o. condition unless termination is reached.

**Specific Mathlib gaps:**

  * **Gap A** (filtration plumbing): `Filtration.natural` requires
    per-coordinate `MetrizableSpace + BorelSpace` instances, not derivable
    automatically from `Countable + MeasurableSingletonClass`. Either
    refine `traceDist`'s typeclass list with discrete-topology instances
    or add a `Filtration.natural_of_countable` Mathlib lemma. ~50 LOC.

  * **Gap B** (kernel-form conditional probability): the conditional
    expectation `μ[D_n.indicator 1 | ℱ n]` w.r.t. the natural filtration
    of `Kernel.trajMeasure` equals (up to AE-equivalence) the per-step
    kernel evaluation. Mathlib has
    `Kernel.map_frestrictLe_trajMeasure_compProd_eq_map_trajMeasure`
    (the disintegration identity, used in `AlmostBox_of_inductive`) but
    the conditional-expectation glue is not packaged. ~150 LOC.

  * **Gap C** (descent assembly for non-monotone `U`): even given
    i.o. step-drop, the descent contradiction needs the i.o.-drop-to-new-min
    strengthening (or an unconditional U-monotonicity field on the
    certificate). The conditional Borel-Cantelli of step (5) provides this
    naturally for "the decrease event happens AT a new minimum" — but
    extracting that requires coupling the i.o.-step result with the
    running-minimum tracking. ~50 LOC of trajectory bookkeeping.

The whole load is the single sorry below. The deterministic
specialisation `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det` below sidesteps gaps
A-B-C by taking U-monotonicity as a trajectory-form hypothesis and
running a pure finite descent. -/

/-! **Retired chain-witness route.** The auxiliary
`pi_n_AST_fair_chain_witness` and its consumer
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_of_chain` previously packaged the
conditional Borel-Cantelli content as a single chain-existence lemma.
That route has been retired in favor of the cleaner
`TrajectoryBCDescent` / `TrajectoryFairRunningMinDropIO` bridge (see
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc` and
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc_of_running_min_drops` below).

`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` is now a thin wrapper around
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc_of_running_min_drops`, taking the
post-Borel-Cantelli running-minimum-drop-IO event as an explicit
hypothesis. The remaining analytic bridge — deriving
`TrajectoryFairRunningMinDropIO` from `cert.U_dec_prob` and
`TrajectoryFairProgress` via conditional Borel-Cantelli — is now an
isolated obligation discharged at the call site (see
`docs/randomized-leslie-spike/13-fair-ast-borel-cantelli-plan.md`,
items 1–3 of the Remaining section). -/

/-! `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` is now defined further down (after
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc_of_running_min_drops`), as a thin
wrapper around the running-minimum-drop bridge. -/

/-! ### Deterministic specialisation — `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det`

For protocols whose distance variant `U` is monotone non-increasing
along every trajectory step and *strictly* decreases on every fair
firing (the deterministic special case of `U_dec_det`), the proof of
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` closes without Borel-Cantelli: a finite
descent argument suffices. We expose this as a sister lemma, taking the
two strengthening conditions as **trajectory-form** hypotheses.

The hypotheses are stated AE on the trace measure:

  * `TrajectoryUMono` — `U` is monotone non-increasing at every step.
  * `TrajectoryFairStrictDecrease` — at every step where a fair-required
    action fires from a non-terminated state below the V-sublevel, `U`
    strictly drops.

Concrete protocols can derive these from `U_dec_det` (specialised to
the deterministic-decrease branch) plus the step-kernel support analysis
already used in `Refinement.AlmostBox_of_inductive`. That derivation is
~100-150 LOC of trajectory plumbing; we leave it to per-protocol work
since it depends on protocol-specific structure (e.g., which non-fair
actions can fire and how they affect `U`).

The general `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` (whose `U_dec_det` allows the
disjunction "decrease *or* a new fair action becomes enabled") plus the
probabilistic `U_dec_prob` path requires the natural filtration on
`Trace σ ι` and conditional Borel-Cantelli — gap 2 of M3 W3, deferred. -/

/-- **Deterministic specialisation** of `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress`.

Closes the sublevel-set finite-variant rule under the stronger
deterministic-decrease conditions: `U` monotone non-increasing and
strictly decreasing on every fair firing (in trajectory form). The
proof is a finite-descent argument — no Borel-Cantelli, no filtration
plumbing.

Uses:
  * `cert.U_bdd_subl N` for the uniform `M`-bound on `U` along the
    sublevel.
  * `Refinement.AlmostBox_of_inductive` to lift `cert.Inv` along the
    trajectory.
  * `Nat.find`-style finite descent: pick `M + 2` strictly-increasing
    fair-firing times via iterated `h_progress`, observe
    `U` strictly decreases from one fair-firing time to the next
    (combining strict-decrease at the firing with mono between firings),
    contradicting `U ≤ M`. -/

/-- **Fair sublevel finite-variant rule with explicit trajectory
progress witness — Borel-Cantelli form.**

Same shape as `pi_n_AST_fair` but takes a `TrajectoryFairProgress`
hypothesis explicitly *plus* a `TrajectoryFairRunningMinDropIO`
witness packaging the conditional Borel-Cantelli output (fair
running-minimum drops happen i.o. on bad traces).

This is the **post-Borel-Cantelli** form of the fair sublevel rule:
the analytic content (deriving the running-minimum-drop-IO event
from `cert.U_dec_prob` plus trajectory fair progress via
conditional Borel-Cantelli) is delegated to the call site. The
deterministic specialisation `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det` covers
all concrete protocols (Bracha, AVSS, common-coin) that satisfy
`U`-monotonicity along trajectories; this general form is a strict
generalisation needed when the per-step decrease is genuinely
probabilistic (e.g., common-coin protocols where the local
randomness can resample `U` on fair firings).

**Internal note:** the previous `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` used a
chain-witness packaging (`pi_n_AST_fair_chain_witness`) that has
been retired in favor of this clearer running-minimum-drop bridge
(see `docs/randomized-leslie-spike/13-fair-ast-borel-cantelli-plan.md`).
The remaining analytic obligation — to derive
`TrajectoryFairRunningMinDropIO` from the certificate fields and the
trajectory fair-progress witness — is documented as items 1–3 of the
plan's Remaining section. Concrete protocols can either close that
obligation per-protocol or use the deterministic specialisation. -/

/-! ### `TrajectoryFairAdversary` — bundle progress witness with the adversary

Resolution path **1c** of the gap-1 finding (see
`docs/randomized-leslie-spike/11-fair-progress-blocker.md`):
`FairnessAssumptions.isWeaklyFair : Adversary → Prop` is opaque, so
the trajectory-form fairness witness cannot be derived from
`A.fair`. Instead of refactoring `FairnessAssumptions` (option 1a)
or threading a progress hypothesis through every caller (option
1b), we bundle the witness with the adversary in a subtype.

Concrete protocols construct a `TrajectoryFairAdversary` by
providing both the fair adversary AND a `TrajectoryFairProgress`
witness. The witness is parametric in the initial measure `μ₀` —
fairness on a specific run, not for all measures uniformly.

The corollary `pi_n_AST_fair_traj_det` shows the soundness path
for protocols satisfying the deterministic specialisation:
`TrajectoryFairAdversary` + `TrajectoryUMono` +
`TrajectoryFairStrictDecrease` ⟹ AS termination. -/

/-- A fair adversary bundled with a trajectory-progress witness for
a specific initial measure `μ₀`.

`progress` is the AE-trajectory statement that fair-required
actions fire i.o. — exactly the trajectory-form predicate the
soundness proof needs but `FairAdversary.fair` doesn't provide. -/

/-! ### `sound_traj_det` deferred

A consumer-friendly `FairASTCertificate.sound_traj_det` corollary
that takes a `TrajectoryFairAdversary` and discharges termination
via `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det` is the natural next step. It
encountered a `whnf` heartbeat-blowup during elaboration of its
signature (specifically the `A.toFair` projection composing with
`TrajectoryUMono` / `TrajectoryFairStrictDecrease`'s implicit args).
The proof body is straightforward (mirrors
`partition_almostDiamond_fair`); deferred to the next polish pass
once the elaboration cost is identified.

Concrete protocols can already use `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det`
directly with `A.toFair` and `A.progress` — the structure provides
the bundle, the corollary just packages the call. -/
