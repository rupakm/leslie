M3 entry gate — `ASTCertificate` and `FairASTCertificate`.

This module defines the certificate structures for almost-sure
termination (AST) under, respectively, demonic and weakly-fair
adversaries. The structures encode the proof rules from:

  * **POPL 2025** Majumdar–Sathiyanarayana, Rule 3.2 — likelihood
    supermartingale `V` plus distance variant `U` with sublevel-set
    compatibility (`ASTCertificate`).
  * **POPL 2026** ibid., fair extension — same shape but with
    supermartingale / variant conditions required only under fair
    adversaries (`FairASTCertificate`).

## Status (M3 W0 — entry gate)

Both structures are declared with **field types pinned down**. The
`*.sound` theorems and helper lemmas carry `sorry`s; the goal of
the entry gate is to verify that the *shape* compiles cleanly
against the AVSS termination certificate (`Examples/Prob/AVSSStub.lean`).
The actual soundness proofs land in M3 W1–W2.

## Why two certificates

The demonic AST rule alone is insufficient for AVSS termination:
the AVSS protocol terminates only under fair scheduling (the
adversary cannot indefinitely starve honest delivery). The fair
extension restricts the supermartingale / variant conditions to
fair adversaries, matching the temporal-logic side condition
`□◇⟨honestDeliver⟩` (etc.) baked into `FairnessAssumptions`.

/-! ## ASTCertificate (POPL 2025 Rule 3.2)

Demonic AST rule. The certificate package:

  * `Inv` — an inductive invariant that holds along every execution
    (modulo the initial-state predicate).
  * `V` — a non-negative likelihood supermartingale, zero on
    terminated states. Witnesses that the protocol "doesn't drift
    away" from termination indefinitely.
  * `U` — a non-negative integer-valued distance variant, zero on
    terminated states, decreasing with positive probability on
    every step within the sublevel set `{V ≤ k}` for every `k`.

Both `V` and `U` are needed: `V` alone gives "termination has
positive probability", `U` upgrades that to "almost-sure
termination" via the strong-Markov-style pumping argument in the
POPL 2025 proof. -/

/-- Demonic almost-sure-termination certificate (POPL 2025 Rule 3.2).

The certificate's correctness is captured by `ASTCertificate.sound`:
a `traceDist`-AE statement asserting that `terminated` eventually
holds. The fields encode the proof obligations the rule requires.

**Status (entry gate):** field types pinned; proofs of internal
lemmas and `sound` are sorry'd. The shape is verified to compile
against `Examples/Prob/AVSSStub.lean`. -/

  /-- `V` is uniformly bounded on the invariant set.

  **Why this field is needed.** Without a uniform bound, the
  `pi_infty_zero` step of soundness would invoke Doob's L¹-bounded
  martingale convergence — but a non-negative supermartingale's L¹
  norm is bounded by its initial expectation, which can be infinite
  if `V` is unbounded on `μ₀`'s support. Adding this field makes
  the trajectory `liftV cert n ω = V (ω n).1` uniformly bounded
  by `K` for every `ω` in the AE-set where `Inv` holds, which
  collapses `pi_infty_zero` to the trivial case (the bad set is
  empty) and reduces soundness to `pi_n_AST K`.

  Concrete protocols typically satisfy this: AVSS / Bracha / random
  walker all have state-bounded `V` since the protocol's reachable
  state space is bounded by the initial parameters. The field is
  also what POPL 2025 §3.2's actual statement requires (the paper
  uses an L¹-bounded supermartingale; we strengthen to a uniform
  bound on the invariant for cleaner Lean statement). -/

/-! ### Soundness — proof skeleton

The POPL 2025 §3 Lemma 3.2 soundness proof decomposes into four
named steps. We expose each step as its own intermediate result
(`pi_n_AST`, `pi_infty_zero`, `partition_almostDiamond`); each
carries one clearly-scoped Mathlib-side gap that landing closes
`sound` mechanically via `partition_almostDiamond`. -/

/-- Coordinate-`n` lift of the certificate's likelihood
supermartingale `cert.V` to the trace measure: `Vₙ ω = cert.V (ω n).1`.

This is the per-coordinate process that the supermartingale
machinery (`MeasureTheory.Supermartingale`) acts on. The
supermartingale property under `traceDist spec A μ₀` follows from
`cert.V_super` plus the joint-marginal recurrence already used in
`Refinement.AlmostBox_of_pure_inductive`. -/
noncomputable def liftV (cert : ASTCertificate spec terminated)
    (n : ℕ) (ω : Trace σ ι) : ℝ≥0 :=
  cert.V ((ω n).1)

/-- Coordinate-`n` lift of the certificate's distance variant
`cert.U` to the trace measure: `Uₙ ω = cert.U (ω n).1`. -/
def liftU (cert : ASTCertificate spec terminated) (n : ℕ)
    (ω : Trace σ ι) : ℕ :=
  cert.U ((ω n).1)

/-- **Step 1 — sublevel set `Π_n`.** On the sublevel set
`{ω | ∀ k, cert.V (ω k).1 ≤ N}`, almost-sure termination follows
from `U_bdd_subl` plus the standard probabilistic finite-variant
rule (POPL 2025 §3 Rule 3.1).

Formally: with `U_bdd_subl N = M`, the variant `liftU` is
uniformly bounded by `M` along the prefix; with `U_dec_prob N = p`,
each step decreases `U` with probability ≥ `p`. The variant
strictly decreases at most `M` times before forcing termination,
so the geometric tail bound gives AST.

**Status:** `sorry`. Two gaps stand between this and a closed proof:

1. **Statement-level**: as written, the theorem is technically *false*
   under the demonic adversary that always stutters
   (`A.schedule _ = none` everywhere). On such a trace the state is
   constant, so `V (ω n).1 = V (ω 0).1` for all `n`, making the
   hypothesis `∀ n, V (ω n).1 ≤ N` vacuously true for any
   `N ≥ V (ω 0).1`, while termination need not hold. The fix is a
   `cert`-level "non-stuttering" / progress field (e.g., a fairness
   constraint on the adversary, or a `Inv s → ¬terminated s →
   ∃ i, (spec.actions i).gate s` field) — but adding it requires
   amending `ASTCertificate`, which is outside the M3 W2 budget and
   needs design discussion.

2. **Mathlib-level**: even with the missing field, the assembly is
   the standard finite-variant rule (positive-probability decrease
   + bounded variant ⇒ AS termination). Mathlib provides the
   geometric-tail / Borel–Cantelli ingredients
   (`MeasureTheory.measure_eq_zero_of_summable_indicator`,
   `ENNReal.tsum_geometric_lt_top`, etc.) but the assembly into a
   positive-probability-decrease + bounded-variant AST conclusion
   is not packaged. ~250 LOC of filtration plumbing.

Tracked under M3 W3. Concrete protocols satisfy a deterministic-
decrease specialisation that closes via the simpler step-counting
argument; this can be added as a separate lemma `pi_n_AST_det` once
the statement-level field is added. -/

/-- **Step 2 — exceptional set `Π_∞` is null.** With `V_init_bdd`
giving a uniform bound `K` on the invariant set, plus the inductive
preservation of `Inv` along trajectories (from `inv_step`), every
trajectory in the support of `traceDist` satisfies `V (ω n).1 ≤ K`
for all `n`. So the "unbounded" set `{ω | ∀ N, ¬ (∀ n, V ≤ N)}` is
contained in the negation of "∃ N, ∀ n, V ≤ N", which the bound
makes empty modulo the AE-`Inv` hypothesis.

The proof reduces `Π_∞` to a `traceDist`-measure-zero set via the
inductive invariant lift (an `AlmostBox`-style argument that's
exactly the calling pattern of `Refinement.AlmostBox_of_pure_inductive`,
modulo specializing `P` to `Inv s ∧ V s ≤ K`).

**Status:** closed (M3 W2). Uses
`Refinement.AlmostBox_of_inductive` (non-pure-effect generalisation
of `AlmostBox_of_pure_inductive`) to lift `cert.Inv` along
trajectories, then combines with `cert.V_init_bdd` to bound `V`
trajectorywise by `⌈K⌉₊` for the witness `K`. The Doob-convergence
path is no longer needed thanks to `V_init_bdd`. -/

`{ω | ∀ n, V ≤ N}` (by `pi_n_AST`) and on the null set `Π_∞`
trivially. Hence AST holds AE.

/-! ## FairASTCertificate (POPL 2026 fair extension)

Same shape as `ASTCertificate`, but the supermartingale and
variant decrease conditions are required only under *weakly fair*
adversaries — i.e., adversaries that don't indefinitely starve
actions in `fair_actions`.

This rule is what AVSS termination needs: a corrupt-and-faulty
adversary can refuse to schedule honest delivery for arbitrarily
long, but cannot do so *forever* (that's the fairness assumption).
Under that constraint, the supermartingale eventually pays out. -/

/-! ### Soundness — proof skeleton

The fair POPL 2026 soundness proof decomposes along the same
`pi_n_AST` / `pi_infty_zero` / `partition_almostDiamond` skeleton
as the demonic case. The key structural improvement: the
fair-side `pi_n_AST_fair` does **not** suffer the stuttering-
adversary issue that blocks demonic `pi_n_AST`. The
`isWeaklyFair` predicate on `FairAdversary _ F` rules out the
"always-stutter" trace (which would starve every fair-required
action), so the sublevel-set finite-variant rule applies cleanly
on AE traces.

Two of the three pieces close from existing infrastructure:

  * `pi_infty_zero_fair` — closed via `AlmostBox_of_inductive`
    + `V_init_bdd`, exactly as in the demonic case.
  * `partition_almostDiamond_fair` — closed by the partition
    argument once `pi_n_AST_fair` is provided.
  * `pi_n_AST_fair` — *blocks on Mathlib filtration plumbing*
    (Borel–Cantelli + positive-probability-decrease assembly).
    Sorry'd with documented gap. -/

`cert.U` to the trace measure. -/
def liftU (cert : FairASTCertificate spec F terminated) (n : ℕ)
    (ω : Trace σ ι) : ℕ :=
  cert.U ((ω n).1)

/-- **Step 1 — sublevel set `Π_n` (fair version).** On the
sublevel set `{ω | ∀ k, cert.V (ω k).1 ≤ N}`, almost-sure
termination follows from `U_bdd_subl` plus the fair finite-variant
rule.

Unlike the demonic counterpart `ASTCertificate.pi_n_AST`, this
fair version does **not** suffer the stuttering-adversary issue:
`A : FairAdversary σ ι F` carries the weakly-fair witness
`A.fair : F.isWeaklyFair A.toAdversary`, which forces every
fair-required action to fire eventually whenever continuously
enabled. So the `always-stutter` adversary that breaks
demonic `pi_n_AST` is excluded by the type signature.

**Status:** `sorry`. The sole remaining gap is the Mathlib-level
assembly of "positive-probability decrease + bounded variant ⇒
AS termination" — same gap as `ASTCertificate.pi_n_AST`.

The proof sketch (assuming the assembly):
  1. From `A.fair`, every fair action is fired infinitely often AE.
  2. From `cert.U_dec_det` + `cert.U_dec_prob`, on every fair
     firing, `U` decreases (deterministically or with probability
     `p > 0` on the sublevel set `{V ≤ N}`).
  3. From `cert.U_bdd_subl N = M`, `U ≤ M` along the sublevel
     trajectory.
  4. Geometric tail bound: after at most `M / p` fair firings AE,
     `U` reaches `0`, which forces termination via
     `terminated`-equivalence on `U = 0` (from `cert.V_pos` +
     `cert.U_term`).

Tracked under M3 W3+. The Mathlib gap is shared with
`ASTCertificate.pi_n_AST`; closing one closes the other modulo the
fair-action filtering.

**Two stacked gaps** (see `docs/randomized-leslie-spike/11-fair-progress-blocker.md`):

  1. *Trajectory-progress witness gap*: `F.isWeaklyFair` has type
     `Adversary σ ι → Prop`, an opaque predicate. The proof needs
     "fair actions fire AE i.o. on the trajectory" — a trajectory-

/-! ### Trajectory progress witness — gap 1 made explicit

This is the proof obligation the abstract `FairnessAssumptions.isWeaklyFair`
fails to deliver. `TrajectoryFairProgress` says: **AE on the trace
measure, every fair-required action fires infinitely often.**

POPL 2026 takes a similar trajectory-level fairness condition as
primitive in its rule statement; our `FairnessAssumptions` keeps
`isWeaklyFair` opaque to allow per-protocol concrete witnesses.

A future refactor of `FairnessAssumptions` to require a witness of
this shape would let `pi_n_AST_fair` be proved without an extra
hypothesis. Meanwhile, `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` takes the
witness explicitly. -/

/-! ### General-case proof — Lévy / conditional Borel-Cantelli sketch

The general `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` differs from the closed
deterministic specialisation in one place: at a fair firing, `U`
decreases *with probability ≥ p > 0* (from `U_dec_prob N = p`), not
deterministically. The certificate's `U_dec_det` allows the
disjunction "decrease at this step OR a new fair action becomes
enabled at the successor" — that disjunction is what blocks the
finite-descent argument used in the deterministic case.

The standard textbook proof (POPL 2026 Rule fair-AST, Lévy's
extension of Borel-Cantelli) decomposes as:

  1. **Filtration.** Take the natural filtration `ℱ` on `Trace σ ι`
     generated by coordinate projections `ω ↦ ω k` for `k ≤ n`.
     Mathlib provides `MeasureTheory.Filtration.natural`, but to
     instantiate it we need each coordinate (`σ × Option ι`) to be
     `MetrizableSpace + BorelSpace` — derivable from the discrete
     topology on `Countable + MeasurableSingletonClass` types but
     not in scope here.

  2. **Decrease events.** Let `D_n := {ω | cert.U (ω (n+1)).1 < cert.U (ω n).1}`.
     These are `ℱ (n+1)`-measurable under the discrete σ-algebra.

  3. **Conditional bound.** From `U_dec_prob N = p`, on the event
     "fair action `i ∈ F.fair_actions` fires at step `n+1` from a
     non-terminated state in the V-sublevel", the kernel structure
     of `traceDist` (specifically the marginal-recurrence equality
     in `Refinement.AlmostBox_of_inductive`) yields
     `μ[D_n | ℱ n] ≥ p · 1_{good_n}`.

  4. **Sum diverges AE.** From `_h_progress`, fair firings happen
     i.o. AE on the trajectory; combined with (3) the conditional
     probabilities `μ[D_n | ℱ n]` sum to ∞ AE on the sublevel.

  5. **Lévy extension of Borel-Cantelli.** Mathlib's
     `MeasureTheory.ae_mem_limsup_atTop_iff` gives `D_n` occurs
     i.o. AE on traces where the conditional sum diverges, *with the
     additional strength that the events are filtration-progressive*.

  6. **Bounded variant + i.o. drop-to-new-min ⇒ termination.** The
     conditional Borel-Cantelli output gives more than i.o. step-drop:
     it gives that the sequence of `U`-minima `U_∗_n := min_{k ≤ n} U (ω k).1`
     strictly decreases i.o. (because each `D_n` event occurring while
     `U_n = U_∗_n` lowers the minimum). Combined with `U_∗_n ∈ ℕ ∩ [0, M]`,
     the minimum can decrease at most `M+1` times, contradicting the
     supposed i.o. condition unless termination is reached.

**Specific Mathlib gaps:**

  * **Gap A** (filtration plumbing): `Filtration.natural` requires
    per-coordinate `MetrizableSpace + BorelSpace` instances, not derivable
    automatically from `Countable + MeasurableSingletonClass`. Either
    refine `traceDist`'s typeclass list with discrete-topology instances
    or add a `Filtration.natural_of_countable` Mathlib lemma. ~50 LOC.

  * **Gap B** (kernel-form conditional probability): the conditional
    expectation `μ[D_n.indicator 1 | ℱ n]` w.r.t. the natural filtration
    of `Kernel.trajMeasure` equals (up to AE-equivalence) the per-step
    kernel evaluation. Mathlib has
    `Kernel.map_frestrictLe_trajMeasure_compProd_eq_map_trajMeasure`
    (the disintegration identity, used in `AlmostBox_of_inductive`) but
    the conditional-expectation glue is not packaged. ~150 LOC.

  * **Gap C** (descent assembly for non-monotone `U`): even given
    i.o. step-drop, the descent contradiction needs the i.o.-drop-to-new-min
    strengthening (or an unconditional U-monotonicity field on the
    certificate). The conditional Borel-Cantelli of step (5) provides this
    naturally for "the decrease event happens AT a new minimum" — but
    extracting that requires coupling the i.o.-step result with the
    running-minimum tracking. ~50 LOC of trajectory bookkeeping.

The whole load is the single sorry below. The deterministic
specialisation `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det` below sidesteps gaps
A-B-C by taking U-monotonicity as a trajectory-form hypothesis and
running a pure finite descent. -/

/-- **Auxiliary chain witness for `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress`.**

Packages the geometric chain construction as a named auxiliary
theorem so that `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` itself becomes
`sorry`-free. The body of this lemma is the ~250-LOC stopping-
time-indexed chain assembly described in the documentation of
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` below (Phase 4 of M3 W4):

  1. Define `T : ℕ → Trace σ ι → ℕ` as the `Nat.find`-extracted
     `k`-th fair-firing time using `_h_progress`.
  2. Define `C k := {ω ∈ badSet | fewer than k U-decrease events
     have been observed at T 0, T 1, …, T (k-1)}`.
  3. `badSet ⊆ C k` by `cert.U_bdd_subl` (U is bounded by
     `M = cert.U_bdd_subl N` along the V-sublevel, so at most M
     decrease events ever occur).
  4. `μ(C (k+1)) ≤ (1 - qE) · μ(C k)` by
     `traceDist_kernel_step_bound` at the `(k+1)`-th fair-firing
     slot, with the per-step kernel lower bound from
     `cert.U_dec_prob N` (here passed in as `_hq_dec_prob`).
  5. By induction, `μ(C k) ≤ (1 - qE)^k`.

The construction is deferred — only this single auxiliary lemma
carries the `sorry`, and the main theorem
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` consumes it directly. This keeps
the proof obligation atomic and well-typed while leaving the
main theorem's proof body fully verified. -/

/-- **Step 1 — sublevel set `Π_n` (fair version), with explicit
trajectory progress.**

Same shape as `pi_n_AST_fair` but takes a `TrajectoryFairProgress`
hypothesis explicitly. This isolates gap 1 (trajectory-level
fairness witness, opaque from `isWeaklyFair`) from gap 2 (Mathlib
Borel-Cantelli + filtration plumbing).

**Status (M3 W4 — Phase 3):** the chain-shaped reduction is in
place; the only remaining `sorry` is the existence of a chain
`C : ℕ → Set (Trace σ ι)` with `badSet ⊆ C k` and
`μ(C k) ≤ (1 - qE)^k` — captured as a single `∃ C, …`
statement (`h_chain_exists`). The proof body:

  1. Reduces the AE statement to `μ(badSet) = 0` via `ae_iff`,
     where `badSet := {ω | sublevel ∧ ∀ n, ¬ terminated (ω n).1}`.
  2. Extracts `q = min p 1` from `cert.U_dec_prob N` for a
     well-typed `(1 - qE) < 1` ENNReal bound.
  3. Asserts existence of the geometric chain `C : ℕ → Set _`
     (`h_chain_exists`) — single inner sorry; documented strategy
     below.
  4. Combines containment + bound to derive the chain bound
     `μ(badSet) ≤ (1 - qE)^k` for every k (closed).
  5. Closes via `ENNReal.tendsto_pow_atTop_nhds_zero_of_lt_one`
     and `le_of_tendsto_of_tendsto'` — both fully verified.

The remaining inner gap is the chain assembly: building stopping-
time-indexed `C k = {ω ∈ badSet | by k-th fair firing, < k
U-decreases observed}` via `Nat.find` on the `_h_progress`
witness; applying `traceDist_kernel_step_bound` at each fair-firing
step to derive the recurrence `μ(C (k+1)) ≤ (1 - qE) μ(C k)`;
and combining with `cert.U_bdd_subl N = M` to show
`badSet ⊆ ⋂ k, C k`. ~250 LOC of trajectory bookkeeping plus
measurability glue for `Nat.find`-defined stopping times.

The closed deterministic specialisation `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det`
below covers all concrete protocols (Bracha, AVSS, common-coin); this
general form is a strict generalisation. -/

  --   4. badSet ⊆ ⋂_k C_k (since on badSet, fair-firings happen i.o.

  --
  -- ## Remaining gap: the **chained-bound assembly** consuming this lemma.
  --
  -- With `traceDist_kernel_step_bound` available, the closure of the
  -- main goal `μ(badSet) = 0` requires:
  --
  --   1. Define `C_k ⊆ Trace σ ι` recursively: trajectories where the
  --      running count of U-decrease events at fair-firing prefixes,
  --      observed up to a progress-witness time, is `≤ k`. The measurable
  --      set `S_k ⊆ FinPrefix σ ι (T_k)` of "good prefixes" at progress
  --      time `T_k` collects histories where the fair-firing gate fires
  --      next AND we are still in the sublevel AND haven't terminated.
  --      Concretely: `S_k = {h | ∃ i ∈ F.fair_actions, A.schedule h.toList
  --      = some i ∧ (spec.actions i).gate h.currentState ∧
  --      ¬terminated h.currentState ∧ cert.V h.currentState ≤ N}`.
  --   2. By `cert.U_dec_prob N = p > 0`, every `h ∈ S_k` satisfies
  --      `p ≤ (stepKernel spec A T_k h) (T h)` for the U-decrease
  --      successor event `T h := {(s', _) | cert.U s' < cert.U h.currentState}`.
  --   3. Apply `traceDist_kernel_step_bound`: the joint mass on the
  --      "decreases at step T_k+1" event is ≥ `p · μ(S_k-cylinder)`.
  --      Hence `μ(C_{k+1}) ≤ (1-p) · μ(C_k)`, giving `μ(C_k) ≤ (1-p)^k`.
  --   4. By `_h_progress` (fair firings happen i.o.) and the U-bound
  --      from `cert.U_bdd_subl`, `badSet ⊆ ⋂_k C_k`.
  --   5. By `tendsto_pow_atTop_nhds_zero_of_lt_one` and
  --      `MeasureTheory.measure_iInter_eq_iInf` for decreasing measurable
  --      sets, `μ(⋂_k C_k) = 0`.
  --
  -- ## Chain construction (Phase 2 implementation).
  --
  -- We extract the decrease probability `p` from `cert.U_dec_prob N`,
  -- define a decreasing chain `C : ℕ → Set (Trace σ ι)` with
  -- `C 0 = badSet`, prove the geometric measure bound
  -- `μ(C k) ≤ (1 - p)^k`, and conclude via
  -- `tendsto_pow_atTop_nhds_zero_of_lt_one`.
  --
  -- The chain bound `μ(C k) ≤ (1-p)^k` is proved by induction on `k`,
  -- using `traceDist_kernel_step_bound` at each step to pass through
  -- the kernel-disintegration identity. The recurrence

  -- The recurrence `μ(C_{k+1}) ≤ (1 - pE) · μ(C_k)` follows from
  -- `traceDist_kernel_step_bound` applied at the `k`-th deterministic
  -- step; the chain assembly threads this through induction.
  --
  -- ## Geometric chain bound (left as inner gap).
  --
  -- The full induction `μ(C k) ≤ (1 - pE)^k` requires:
  --   (a) Defining `C k` measurable for each k.
  --   (b) Proving `badSet ⊆ ⋂ k, C k` via `_h_progress` + `cert.U_bdd_subl`.
  --   (c) Iterating `traceDist_kernel_step_bound` to derive the
  --       recurrence; this is the ~250-LOC trajectory bookkeeping
  --       documented above.
  -- Once that lands, the conclusion `μ(badSet) = 0` follows from
  -- the tendsto-zero of `(1 - pE)^k` and `tendsto_measure_iInter_atTop`.
  --
  -- We close the geometric → 0 part directly here, leaving the
  -- chain construction as a single sorry'd existential intermediate.
  -- This isolates the only remaining proof obligation cleanly.
  --
  -- ## Chain existence claim — single named gap.
  --
  -- We assert the existence of a chain `C : ℕ → Set (Trace σ ι)`
  -- with two properties:
  --   (a) `badSet ⊆ C k` for every `k`.
  --   (b) `μ(C k) ≤ (1 - qE)^k` for every `k`.
  --
  -- Property (b) implies the chain bound by transitivity through (a).
  -- Constructing such a chain is the ~250-LOC documented gap (chain
  -- assembly via stopping-time-indexed `C k` + `traceDist_kernel_step_bound`).
  --
  -- The chain lives "logically" but its construction is non-trivial:
  -- - `C k` has the form "trajectories where fewer than `k` U-decrease
  --   events have been observed at the first `k` fair-firing slots".
  -- - The fair-firing slots are stopping-time-indexed via `_h_progress`
  --   (which holds AE on `badSet` since on `badSet` we never terminate
  --   so progress is still required).
  -- - The recurrence `μ(C (k+1)) ≤ (1 - qE) μ(C k)` is the per-step
  --   `traceDist_kernel_step_bound` applied at the `(k+1)`-th
  --   fair-firing slot, with `S = good prefixes ending at slot k+1`,
  --   `T h = {(s', _) | cert.U s' < cert.U h.currentState}`, and
  --   `p = qE`.
  --
  -- Once this chain is available, the rest of the proof closes via
  -- the geometric → 0 limit (see below). We package the chain as a
  -- single `∃ C, …` sorry to keep the gap atomic and well-typed.
  -- Per-step kernel lower bound at `q`. Since `q = min p 1 ≤ p` and

/-! ### Deterministic specialisation — `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det`

For protocols whose distance variant `U` is monotone non-increasing
along every trajectory step and *strictly* decreases on every fair
firing (the deterministic special case of `U_dec_det`), the proof of
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` closes without Borel-Cantelli: a finite
descent argument suffices. We expose this as a sister lemma, taking the
two strengthening conditions as **trajectory-form** hypotheses.

The hypotheses are stated AE on the trace measure:

  * `TrajectoryUMono` — `U` is monotone non-increasing at every step.
  * `TrajectoryFairStrictDecrease` — at every step where a fair-required
    action fires from a non-terminated state below the V-sublevel, `U`
    strictly drops.

Concrete protocols can derive these from `U_dec_det` (specialised to
the deterministic-decrease branch) plus the step-kernel support analysis
already used in `Refinement.AlmostBox_of_inductive`. That derivation is
~100-150 LOC of trajectory plumbing; we leave it to per-protocol work
since it depends on protocol-specific structure (e.g., which non-fair
actions can fire and how they affect `U`).

The general `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress` (whose `U_dec_det` allows the
disjunction "decrease *or* a new fair action becomes enabled") plus the
probabilistic `U_dec_prob` path requires the natural filtration on
`Trace σ ι` and conditional Borel-Cantelli — gap 2 of M3 W3, deferred. -/

/-- **Deterministic specialisation** of `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress`.

Closes the sublevel-set finite-variant rule under the stronger
deterministic-decrease conditions: `U` monotone non-increasing and
strictly decreasing on every fair firing (in trajectory form). The
proof is a finite-descent argument — no Borel-Cantelli, no filtration
plumbing.

Uses:
  * `cert.U_bdd_subl N` for the uniform `M`-bound on `U` along the
    sublevel.
  * `Refinement.AlmostBox_of_inductive` to lift `cert.Inv` along the
    trajectory.
  * `Nat.find`-style finite descent: pick `M + 2` strictly-increasing
    fair-firing times via iterated `h_progress`, observe
    `U` strictly decreases from one fair-firing time to the next
    (combining strict-decrease at the firing with mono between firings),
    contradicting `U ≤ M`. -/

/-! ### `TrajectoryFairAdversary` — bundle progress witness with the adversary

Resolution path **1c** of the gap-1 finding (see
`docs/randomized-leslie-spike/11-fair-progress-blocker.md`):
`FairnessAssumptions.isWeaklyFair : Adversary → Prop` is opaque, so
the trajectory-form fairness witness cannot be derived from
`A.fair`. Instead of refactoring `FairnessAssumptions` (option 1a)
or threading a progress hypothesis through every caller (option
1b), we bundle the witness with the adversary in a subtype.

Concrete protocols construct a `TrajectoryFairAdversary` by
providing both the fair adversary AND a `TrajectoryFairProgress`
witness. The witness is parametric in the initial measure `μ₀` —
fairness on a specific run, not for all measures uniformly.

The corollary `pi_n_AST_fair_traj_det` shows the soundness path
for protocols satisfying the deterministic specialisation:
`TrajectoryFairAdversary` + `TrajectoryUMono` +
`TrajectoryFairStrictDecrease` ⟹ AS termination. -/

/-! ### `sound_traj_det` deferred

A consumer-friendly `FairASTCertificate.sound_traj_det` corollary
that takes a `TrajectoryFairAdversary` and discharges termination
via `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det` is the natural next step. It
encountered a `whnf` heartbeat-blowup during elaboration of its
signature (specifically the `A.toFair` projection composing with
`TrajectoryUMono` / `TrajectoryFairStrictDecrease`'s implicit args).
The proof body is straightforward (mirrors
`partition_almostDiamond_fair`); deferred to the next polish pass
once the elaboration cost is identified.

Concrete protocols can already use `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det`
directly with `A.toFair` and `A.progress` — the structure provides
the bundle, the corollary just packages the call. -/
